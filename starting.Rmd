# Getting Started {#starting}

From R, getting started with Spark using a local cluster is as easy as running, `library(sparklyr)` followed by:

```{r eval=FALSE}
spark_install()
sc <- spark_connect(master = "local")
```

To make sure we can all run the code above and understand it, this chapter will walk you through installing the prerequisites, installing Spark, connecting to a local Spark cluster and briefly explaining how to use Spark.

If a Spark cluster and R environment has been made available to you, you do not need to install the [prerequisites] nor [install Spark](installing-spark) yourself. Instead, you should ask for the Spark `master` parameter and connect as follows, this parameter will be formally introduced under the [clusters] and [connections] chapters.

```{r eval=FALSE}
sc <- spark_connect(master = "yarn")
```

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

As briefly mentioned in the [Introduction] chapter, R is a programming language that can run in many platforms and environments. Most people making use of a programming language also choose tools to make them more productive in it; for R, RStudio would be such tool. Strictly speaking, RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment or IDE for short, which also happens to support many platforms and environments. R and RStudio are the free software tools this book will make use of and therefore, I strongly recommend you get those installed if you haven't done so already. 

Additionally, since Spark is build in the Scala programming language which is run by the Java Virtual Machine, you also need to install Java 8 in your system. It is likely that your system already has Java installed, but you should still check the version and update if needed as described in the [Install Java] section.

### Install R

From [r-project.org](https://r-project.org/), download and launch the installer for your platform, Windows, Macs or Linux available.

```{r r-download, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap='The R Project for Statistical Computing.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/starting-download-r.png")
```
![The R Project for Statistical Computing.](images/starting-download-r.png)

### Install Java {#install-java}

From [oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html), download and launch the installer for your platform, Windows, Macs or Linux available. While installing the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is sufficient for most operations, in order to build extensions you will need the JDK (Java Developer Kit); therefore, I rather recommend installing the JDK in the first place.

```{r java-download, eval=FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Java Download.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/starting-jdk-8.png")
```
![Java Download.](images/starting-jdk-8.png)

Starting with Spark 2.1, Java 8 is required; however, previous versions of Spark support Java 7. Regardless, we recommend installing Java 8 as described in this chapter

### Install RStudio

While installing RStudio is not strictly required to work with `sparklyr` in R, it will make you much more productive and therefore, I would recommend you take the time to install RStudio from [rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), then download and launch the installer for your platform: Windows, Macs or Linux.

```{r rstudio-download, eval=FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='RStudio Downloads.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/starting-rstudio.png")
```
![RStudio Downloads.](images/starting-rstudio.png)

After launching RStudio, identify the Console panel since this is where most of the code will be executed in this book. For additional learning resources on R and RStudio consider visiting: [rstudio.com/online-learning/](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/).

### Install sparklyr

First of all, we would want to install `sparkylr`. As many other R packages, `sparklyr` is available in [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sparklyr) and can be easily installed as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sparklyr")
```

The CRAN release of `sparklyr` contains the most stable version and it's the recommended version to use; however, for those that need or might want to try newer features being developed in `sparklyr` you can install directly from GitHub using the `devtools` package. First install the `devtools` package and then `sparklyr` as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/sparklyr")
```

## Installing Spark {#installing-spark}

Start by loading `sparklyr`, 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(sparklyr)
```

This will makes all `sparklyr` functions available in R, which is really helpful; otherwise, we would have to run each `sparklyr` command prefixed with `sparklyr::`.

As mentioned, Spark can be easily installed by running `spark_install()`; this will install the latest version of Spark locally in your computer, go ahead and run `spark_install()`. Notice that this command requires internet connectivity to download Spark.

```{r eval=FALSE}
spark_install()
```

All the versions of Spark that are available for installation can be displayed with `spark_available_versions()`:

```{r}
spark_available_versions()
```

A specific version can be installed using the Spark version and, optionally, by also specifying the Hadoop version. For instance, to install Spark 1.6.3, we would run `spark_install("1.6.3")`.

You can also check which versions are installed by running:

```{r eval=FALSE}
spark_installed_versions()
```
```
  spark hadoop                              dir
7 2.3.1    2.7 /spark/spark-2.3.1-bin-hadoop2.7
```

Finally, in order to uninstall an specific version of Spark you can run `spark_uninstall()` by specifying the Spark and Hadoop versions, for instance:

```{r eval=FALSE}
spark_uninstall(version = "2.3.1", hadoop = "2.7")
```

## Connecting to Spark

It's important to mention that, so far, we've only installed a local Spark cluster. A local cluster is really helpful to get started, test code and troubleshoot with ease; further chapters will explain where to find, install and connect to real Spark clusters with many machines; but for the first few chapters, we will focus on using local clusters.

Threfore, to connect to this local cluster we simply run:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sc <- spark_connect(master = "local")
```

The `master` parameter helps `sparklyr` find which is the "main" machine from the Spark cluster, this machine is often call the driver node. While working with real clusters using many machines, most machines will be worker machines and one will be the master. Since we only have a local cluster with only one machine, we will default to use `"local"` for now.

## Using Spark {#sparklyr-hello-world}

Now that you are connected, we can run a few simple commands. For instance, let's start by loading some data into Apache Spark.

To accomplish this, lets first create a text file by running:

```{r eval=FALSE}
write("Hello World!", "hello.txt")
```

We can now read this text file back from Spark by running:

```{r eval=FALSE}
spark_read_text(sc, "hello", "hello.txt")
```
```
## # Source: spark<hello> [?? x 1]
##   line        
## * <chr>       
## 1 Hello World!
```

**Congrats!** You have successfully connected and loaded your first dataset into Spark.

Let's explain what's going on in `spark_read_text()`. The first parameter, `sc`, gives the function a reference to the active Spark Connection that was earlier created with `spark_connect()`. The second parameter names this dataset in Spark. The third parameter specifies a path to the file to load into Spark. Now, `spark_read_text()` returns a reference to the dataset in Spark which R automatically prints. Whenever a Spark dataset is printed, `sparklyr` will **collect** some of the records and display them for you. In this particular case, that dataset contains just one row for the line: `Hello World!`.

We will now use this simple example to present various useful tools in Spark we should get familiar with.

### Web Interface {#spark-web-interface}

Most of the Spark commands will get started from the R console; however, it is often the case that monitoring and analyzing execution is done through Sparks web interface. This interface is a web page provided by Spark which can be accessed from `sparklyr` by running:

```{r eval=FALSE}
spark_web(sc)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
invisible(webshot::webshot(
  "http://localhost:4040/",
  "images/starting-spark-web.png",
  cliprect = c(0, 0, 992, 600)
))
```
```{r spark-web, eval = FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Apache Spark Web Interface.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/starting-spark-web.png")
```
![Apache Spark Web Interface.](images/starting-spark-web.png)

As mentioned, printing the "hello" dataset collected a few records to be displayed in the R console. You can see in the Spark web interface that a job was started to collect this information back from Spark. You can also select the **storage** tab to see the "hello" dataset cached in-memory in Spark:


```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
invisible(webshot::webshot(
  "http://localhost:4040/storage/",
  "images/starting-spark-web-storage.png",
  cliprect = c(0, 0, 992, 300)
))
```
```{r spark-web-storage, eval=FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Apache Spark Web Interface - Storage Tab.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/starting-spark-web-storage.png")
```
![Apache Spark Web Interface - Storage Tab.](images/starting-spark-web-storage.png)

The [caching](tunning-caching) section in the [tunning] chapter will cover this in detail, but as a start, it's worth noticing that this dataset is fully loaded into memory since the **fraction cached** is 100%, it is useful also to point out the **size in memory** column which tracks the total memory being used by this dataset.

### Logs

Another common tool to use in Spark that you should familiarize with are the Spark logs. A log is just a text file where Spark will append information relevant to the execution of tasks in the cluster. For local clusters, we can retrieve all the logs by running:

```{r eval=FALSE}
spark_log(sc, n = 5)
```
```
18/10/09 19:41:46 INFO Executor: Finished task 0.0 in stage 5.0 (TID 5). 1499 bytes result sent to driver
18/10/09 19:41:46 INFO TaskSetManager: Finished task 0.0 in stage 5.0 (TID 5) in 32 ms on localhost (executor driver) (1/1)
18/10/09 19:41:46 INFO TaskSchedulerImpl: Removed TaskSet 5.0, whose tasks have all completed, from pool 
18/10/09 19:41:46 INFO DAGScheduler: ResultStage 5 (collect at utils.scala:197) finished in 0.039 s
18/10/09 19:41:46 INFO DAGScheduler: Job 3 finished: collect at utils.scala:197, took 0.043086 s
```

Or we can retrieve specific log entries containing, say `sparklyr`, by using the `filter` parameter as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
spark_log(sc, filter = "sparklyr", n = 5)
```
```

```

## Disconnecting

For local clusters and really, any cluster; once you are done processing data you should disconnect by running:

```{r eval=FALSE}
spark_disconnect(sc)
```

this will terminate the connection to the cluster but also terminate the cluster tasks as well. If multiple Spark connections are active, or if the conneciton instance `sc` is no longer available, you can also disconnect all your Spark connections by running `spark_disconnect_all()`.

## RStudio {#using-spark-from-rstudio}

If you are not familiar with RStudio, you will want to identify at least the following panes:

- **Console**: This is just a standalone R console you can use to execute all the code presented in this book.
- **Packages**: This pane allows you to install `sparklyr` with ease, check its version, navigate to the help contents, etc.
- **Connections**: This pane allows you to connecto to Spark, manage your active connection and view the available datasets.

```{r spark-rstudio-overview, eval=FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='RStudio Overview.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/starting-rstudio-overview.png")
```
![RStudio Overview.](images/starting-rstudio-overview.png)

To start a new connections to Spark, you can use `spark_connect()` from the R console or, alternatevely, use the **new connection** action from the **connections pane** and then, select the Spark connection.

Once a Spark connection is selected, you can customize the versions and connect to Spark which will simply generate the right `spark_connect()` command and execute this in the R console for you:

```{r spark-rstudio-new-spark-connection, eval = FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='RStudio New Spark Connection.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/starting-rstudio-new-spark-connection.png")
```
![RStudio New Spark Connection.](images/starting-rstudio-new-spark-connection.png)

Once connected to Spark, either by using the R console or through RStudio's connections pane, RStudio will display your datasets available in the connections pane. This is a useful way to track your existing datasets and provides an easy way to explore each of them:

```{r spark-rstudio-connections-pane, eval = FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='RStudio Connections Pane.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/starting-rstudio-connections-pane.png")
```
![RStudio Connections Pane.](images/starting-rstudio-connections-pane.png)

Additionally, an active connection provides the following custom actions:

- **Spark UI**: Opens the Spark web interface, a shortcut to `spark_ui(sc)`.
- **Log**: Opens the Spark web logs, a shortcut to `spark_log(sc)`.
- **SQL**: Opens a new SQL query, see `DBI` and SQL support in the data [analysis] chapter.
- **Help**: Opens the `sparklyr` reference documentation in a new web browser window.
- **Disconnect**: Disconnects from Spark, a shortcut to `spark_disconnect(sc)`.

The rest of this book will not cover any additional topics related to RStudio, whether you are using plain R from a terminal or the R console from RStudio, the code provided in this book executes in the same way across any R environment.

## Recap

This chapter walked you through installing R, Java, RStudio and `sparklyr` as the main tools required to use Spark from R. We covered installing local Spark clusters using `spark_install()`, connecting using `spark_connect()` and learned how to launch the web interface and logs using `spark_web(sc)` and `spark_log(sc)` respectedly.

It is my hope that this chapter will help anyone interested in learning cluster computing using Spark and R to get you started, ready to experiment on your own and ready to tackle actual data analysis and modeling tasks without any makor blockers. However, if you hit any installation or connection issues, start by browsing online for the error message or open a GitHub issue under [https://github.com/rstudio/sparklyr/issues](https://github.com/rstudio/sparklyr/issues) to help you get going.
